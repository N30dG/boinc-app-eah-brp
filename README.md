BOINC Einstein@Home Binary Radio Pulsar search adapted for Debian Linux

BOINC stands for the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing and
is the default infrastructure for volunteer computing. Such projects invite
the public to contribute their compute facilities (desktops, laptop, 
and increasingly IoT devices) to help tackling computational challenges.

BRP stands for Binary Radio Pulsars. The LIGO collaboration has huge data
collected that indicates their location and the Einstein@Home community
helps with identifying those whereabouts. This project is well-funded and
well-staffed and there would not be any reason to come up with any project
like this if this was not a the immediate urge felt to invite additional
platforms to join that search. And with the huge variety of these platforms,
especially for ARM, upstream would diversify too much. This Debian package
shall help the ambitious helping hands to compile the sources best optimised
for their local hardware at hand.
